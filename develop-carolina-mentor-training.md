Being equipped to pour into a fellow.

A dance between mentor and fellow.

Develop Carolina will be pouring into the fellow.

How does this compare to an intership?
- Intership is short term.
- Fellowship is connecting them to the team to be a contributing team member.  Match with fellows that are best candidates to join your team permenantly.

We all need to be on the same page with what the fellow will learn in 6 months.

- Grooming backlog with beginner tasks
- Making a connection with the Fellow.  Making them comforatble to ask questions and get help.
- Tricky balance between not overwhelming them.  Not items for immedidate delivery. Make them feel empowered to ask questions and ask for help.  There is value in making them struggle.
- Mentor is a lifeline.  Carving out time.  4hrs per week to help the fellow.  Take questions.  Pair up to solve problem .

- Explorer.  maybe interested, free code camp is good resources for them.  A fellowship is NOT for them.
- Student - Maybe handled a couple of isolated problems.  University.  Boot Camp. Self taught.  Learning theory.  This is not what a fellowship is.
- Fellow - bridging between.  Comforatble with team culture.  Fit in with team.  Work along side the team.  help them become a practicioner.

## EngineerKit

- Work on full SDLC.  Exposure.  Not a specialist.  Want them to become a generalist.  Skills that are useful for most softwrae teams.
- We are bringing in what is important for our (hyper) team.

- Every module has resources.  Learn about a concept quickly and a great jumping off point.
- Mini projects throughout 6 months.  Ex:  Download and use wireshark and inspect packets.
