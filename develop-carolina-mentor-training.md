Being equipped to pour into a fellow.

A dance between mentor and fellow.

Develop Carolina will be pouring into the fellow.

How does this compare to an intership?
- Intership is short term.
- Fellowship is connecting them to the team to be a contributing team member.  Match with fellows that are best candidates to join your team permenantly.

We all need to be on the same page with what the fellow will learn in 6 months.

- Grooming backlog with beginner tasks
- Making a connection with the Fellow.  Making them comforatble to ask questions and get help.
- Tricky balance between not overwhelming them.  Not items for immedidate delivery. Make them feel empowered to ask questions and ask for help.  There is value in making them struggle.
- Mentor is a lifeline.  Carving out time.  4hrs per week to help the fellow.  Take questions.  Pair up to solve problem .
