Being equipped to pour into a fellow.

A dance between mentor and fellow.

Develop Carolina will be pouring into the fellow.

How does this compare to an intership?
- Intership is short term.
- Fellowship is connecting them to the team to be a contributing team member.  Match with fellows that are best candidates to join your team permenantly.

We all need to be on the same page with what the fellow will learn in 6 months.
next 8 sessions

- Grooming backlog with beginner tasks
- Making a connection with the Fellow.  Making them comforatble to ask questions and get help.
- Tricky balance between not overwhelming them.  Not items for immedidate delivery. Make them feel empowered to ask questions and ask for help.  There is value in making them struggle.
- Mentor is a lifeline.  Carving out time.  4hrs per week to help the fellow.  Take questions.  Pair up to solve problem .

- Explorer.  maybe interested, free code camp is good resources for them.  A fellowship is NOT for them.
- Student - Maybe handled a couple of isolated problems.  University.  Boot Camp. Self taught.  Learning theory.  This is not what a fellowship is.
- Fellow - bridging between.  Comforatble with team culture.  Fit in with team.  Work along side the team.  help them become a practicioner.

## EngineerKit

- Work on full SDLC.  Exposure.  Not a specialist.  Want them to become a generalist.  Skills that are useful for most softwrae teams.
- We are bringing in what is important for our (hyper) team.

- Every module has resources.  Learn about a concept quickly and a great jumping off point.
- Mini projects throughout 6 months.  Ex:  Download and use wireshark and inspect packets.

<Here are some of the slides on these 15 modules and topics.  Slides below are Not comprehensive. Sorry :(>

Well have access to GH repo for EngineerKit.  Resources.  Mini project. That will go live at the end of the year.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2467354/142067366-3e973e96-7867-4ab8-8ee4-733ae45e4f9f.png)

- Improvement: Pour yourself into your craft.  Continuous Improvement to the craft.  Constantly learning new things.  Helping others along the way.  THis is internal.  
- Fulfillment: Discovering Joy in the work you do.  Being able to love what you do even in hard times. Where can you find fulfillment.This is intenral
- Accomplishment:  Demonstrating skills in your work.  Demonstrate Quality in your work.  This is the fruit of my labor.

- When you are talking to the Fellow talking about fulfillment.  Depends on how they view fulfillment.  The fulfillment comes from learning everyday and I feel as though I never left school which is great to have a carrer where you are constantly flexing the muscle that is your brain. 
- What are some things that I have learned that I can intentially pass along to the fellow.

Skill development in 3 steps

- `shu` - protect or defend.  A fellows growth.  Give structure.  Follow the rules.  Use Git commands.  Merge PRs.   Good first tasks.  
- `ha` - as abilities are built and we gain confidence around their abilities.  We start to have trust in their abilities. As they get momentum they can take on more complicated tickets. 
- `r`i - full autonomy.  After the fellowship.
